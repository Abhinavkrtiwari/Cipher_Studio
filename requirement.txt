CipherStudio Assignment Document
Title: Build CipherStudio - Your Browser-Based React IDE
1. Objective
Your task is to design and implement a browser-based React IDE called CipherStudio, where users can:
Create and manage multiple files for a React project.
Write React code in the browser.
Run and preview their project live inside the browser.
Save and reload their projects to continue later.
The goal is to simulate a real online development environment similar to platforms like NextLeap.js or CodeSandbox, while testing your full-stack design thinking, frontend skills, and integration ability.

2. Features to Implement
Core Features (Required):
File Management: Users can create, delete, and organize project files.
Code Editor: A rich code editor to write React components (Monaco Editor or Sandpack).
Live Preview: Display the React project output in real-time as the code changes.
Save & Load Projects: Users can save their project state and reload it later from localStorage with the help of projectId.
UI/UX: Clean and intuitive interface
Optional/Bonus Features:
Theme switcher (dark/light).
Rename files/folders
Login/Register 
Deployment/Hosting
Autosave feature (toggle)
Responsive UI: Usable on desktop and tablet screens.


You may use open-source libraries (like Sandpack) for React code execution. The goal is integration and feature implementation, not building a compiler from scratch.

3. Tech Stack
Layer
Recommended Technology
Frontend
React / Next.js
Code Execution
Sandpack (CodeSandbox)
Editor
Monaco Editor or Sandpack editor
Database
MongoDB (Atlas preferred) and AWS S3 for files
Backend
Node.js / Express.js (for project persistence)
Deployment
Vercel (Frontend) + Render/Railway/Cyclic (Backend)


You may choose alternatives if needed, but ensure they support the required functionality.
